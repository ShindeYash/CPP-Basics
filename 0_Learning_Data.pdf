### Tips from series Zero-to-Hero ###

(1) Instead of using "#include<iostream>", "#include<math>", "#include<string>"
    you can directly use only single module named "#inlcude<bits/stdc++.h>".
    It will add the all the modules without having to include them individually.
    Only con of using it is that it will increase the compilation time.
    It will not affect the program execution in any way.
